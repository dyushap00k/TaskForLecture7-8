# TaskForLecture7-8
in order to get to the pages of logged in users, you must:
- start Tomcat (I use 9.0.70)
- add /login to the context path
- follow the registration link below
- create Name, Login and Password in the given sequence
- Name, Login and Password must not contain spaces, otherwise you will not be able to register
- also, the login must contain at least 6 characters, and the password must contain at least 8
- after registration you will need to enter your login and password again to get to the welcome page
- on the welcome page there will be a top menu with two items
- choose the right one
